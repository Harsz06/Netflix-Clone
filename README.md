# Netflix-Clone
Netflix Clone Project
I created a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS, replicating the sleek and modern design of the popular streaming platform. This project includes:

A responsive and visually appealing homepage.
Styled sections for featured content, categories, and navigation.
A user-friendly layout inspired by Netflix's interface.
The goal of this project was to enhance my web development skills by applying what I’ve learned about front-end design and responsiveness. It helped me understand the importance of clean code, structured layouts, and creative styling.

As I continue to explore web development, I’m diving into JavaScript, APIs, and advanced tools to make my projects more dynamic and interactive. This clone project is a stepping stone toward mastering more complex and functional web applications.
